Before logging an issue, please make sure that you are using latest version on npm. If you are testing a development version (@next on npm or the version on GitHub), please make sure that you let me know as well.

Please ensure that as much of the following information is included as possible:

### Software and Package Versions

Software       | Version
-------------- | -------
Node.JS        | 
npm            | 
Node-RED       | 
fs node        | 
OS             | 
Browser        | 

> Note that a browser version less than current-2 or IE < v11 very unlikely to work.

### How is Node-RED installed? Where is uibuilder installed?

> Often, issues with nodes occur because of non-standard installations.
  This may still indicate a bug so it is fine to report an issue. Just be sure you understand the consequences of how you have installed things.
  
> A very common set of issues come from installing nodes as root instead of the user that runs Node-RED (e.g. using sudo on Mac/Linux). You will most likely be asked to undo that before we can analyse the issue.

> Also quite common is to install the uibuilder node in the wrong folder. It is best to install using the Node-RED admin interface "Manage Palette". If installing manually, make sure you are in your `userDir` folder before installing (typically `~/.node-red`).
