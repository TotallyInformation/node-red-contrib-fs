<h1>
	Filing System Utilities: File Lister
</h1>
<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Implement the subfolder processing
	</li>
	<li>
		Implement the Single message output option.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This node searches a folder (and optionally sub-folders) for files. optionally
	may filter on a specific file extension.
</p>
<p>
	The folder and files come from the computer and operating dystem that is
	running Node-Red.
</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>
	By default, returns one message for each file found. The filename will be
	in the msg.payload.
	 unless the <i>Output Single Message</i>
	option is chosen.
</p>
<p>
	If the <i>Output Single Message</i> option is chosen, the msg.payload will
	contain an <i>array</i> of filenames.
</p>
<p>
	Output filenames will contain the full file path if the <i>Full Path</i>
	option is selected.
</p>
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Start Folder</b> String containing the start folder location to search
		for files. Without a leading '/', will search from the location the node
		is installed which is not terribly useful so it is preferred to use
		absolute paths. e.g. /home/pi<br />
		Windows path names are also accepted. On Windows, you can use either form.
		There is no need to escape backslashes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Extension</b> String that will be matched to the <i>end</i> of any
		filenames found. Filenames <i>not</i> matching will be filtered out.
		Defaults to '.json', leave blank to get all files.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Search sub-folders</b> Checkbox. If selected, sub-folders under the
		start folder will also be searched.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Include full path in output</b> Checkbox. If selected (the default),
		the output payload will have the folder path prepended to the filename.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Single</b> Checkbox. If selected, only one msg will be sent; the
		msg.payload will contain an array of filenames.<br />
		Otherwise, the default output is a single msg for each file found with
		the msg.payload a string containing the filename.
	</li>
</ul>
