	<h2>
		Filing System Utilities: File Lister
	</h2>
	<h3>To Do</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Allow other overrides to be passed in.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What does this node do?</h3>
	<p>
		This node searches a folder (and optionally sub-folders) for files. optionally
		may filter on a specific file pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		The folder and files come from the computer and operating system that is
		running Node-Red. AKA, the "host".
	</p>
	<h3>Outputs</h3>
	<p>
		By default, returns one message for each file found. The filename will be
		in the msg.payload.
		 unless the <i>Output Single Message</i>
		option is chosen.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the <i>Output Single Message</i> option is chosen, the msg.payload will
		contain an <i>array</i> of filenames.
	</p>
	<p>
		Output filenames will contain the full file path if the <i>Full Path</i>
		option is selected.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the "Return file details" option is selected, each file output will be
		an object. {"name":[filename], "stat": {"size":[fsize], ...}}
	</p>
	<h3>Inputs</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Start Folder</b> [start] String containing the start folder location to search
			for files. Without a leading '/', will search from the location the node
			is installed which is not terribly useful so it is preferred to use
			absolute paths. e.g. /home/pi<br />
			Windows path names are also accepted. On Windows, you can use either form.
			There is no need to escape backslashes.
			Max path length is 1024
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>File Pattern</b> [pattern] String that will be matched against the filenames.
			Standard "glob" file patterns are allowed. Defaults to '*' which will return all files.
			Max length is 1024
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Search sub-folders</b> Checkbox. If selected, sub-folders under the
			start folder will also be searched.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Sub-folder Depth</b> Integer. Default 0 only searches the start folder.
			Limits the depth of sub-folders that will be searched.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Include full path in output</b> Checkbox. If selected (the default),
			the output payload will have the folder path prepended to the filename.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Single</b> Checkbox. If selected, only one msg will be sent; the
			msg.payload will contain an array of filenames.<br />
			Otherwise, the default output is a single msg for each file found with
			the msg.payload a string containing the filename.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To override the configured options, pass in a msg with msg.payload like:
		<code>{"start":"/my/folder","pattern":"*.json"}</code>
		Any missing options will be picked up from the configured node. Only those 2
		overrides are currently available.
	</p>
